# taskmanagment

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# Test Overview:
Objective: Develop a Flutter application that utilizes Firebase for online CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and SQFLite for offline data storage and management. The application should seamlessly synchronize data between the local SQFLite database and the Firebase database.
Duration: 1 Day Submission Requirements:
● Source code repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket)
● A recorded demo or screenshots showing the app's functionality


# Test Scenario: Task Management App
Task Description:
Develop a simple task management application that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. The app should work both online and offline, synchronizing data between Firebase and the local SQFLite database when the internet connection is available.
Features:
Firebase Integration:
● Set up a Firebase project and integrate it with the Flutter app.
● Use Firestore or Firebase Realtime Database for storing tasks.
SQFLite Integration:
● Implement local storage using SQFLite.
● Store tasks with at least the following fields: id, title, description,
dueDate, status. CRUD Operations:
● Create: Add new tasks via a form. Tasks should be saved both locally and on Firebase.
● Read: Display a list of tasks from the local SQFLite database. Implement pull-to-refresh to sync with Firebase.
● Update: Enable editing of task details with changes reflected both locally and on Firebase.
● Delete: Allow tasks to be deleted with changes reflected both locally and on Firebase.
Data Synchronization:
● Implement a mechanism to synchronize data between SQFLite and
Firebase. Ensure that the local database is updated with Firebase data
when the app goes online. User Interface:
● Develop a user-friendly interface for managing tasks. Include screens for listing tasks, adding a new task, and editing an existing task.
Error Handling and Validation:
● Implement error handling for network issues and data validation for the
task form.


# Evaluation Criteria:
● Functionality: The app meets all the specified requirements, performing CRUD operations effectively both online and offline.
● Code Quality: The code is well-organized, commented, and follows best practices and Flutter conventions.
● Data Synchronization: The app effectively synchronizes data between Firebase and SQFLite, handling conflicts and network issues gracefully.
● User Interface: The app provides an intuitive and responsive user interface.
● Error Handling: The app gracefully handles and displays errors, especially for
network issues and data validation.

# Additional Notes:
● Encourage candidates to use state management solutions (e.g., Provider, Bloc, Getx, Riverpod) for better state handling.
